MFCC= Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients
It’s a feature used in automatic speech and speaker recognition. Essentially, it’s a way to represent the short-term power spectrum of a sound which helps machines understand and process human speech more effectively.
Just as humans have fingerprints which are unique, MFCC generates a kind of a unique 'fingerprint' for each audio sample.

Parameter      	              Definition	                                                  How It Affects Feature Extraction?
n_mfcc	                      Number of MFCC coefficients to extract	                      More coefficients capture finer frequency details, but too many may introduce noise
sr (Sampling Rate)	          Number of samples per second (Hz)	                            Higher sampling rates capture more details but increase computational cost
n_fft (FFT Window Size)	      Number of samples in each FFT window	                        Larger values improve frequency resolution but reduce time resolution
hop_length	                  Step size between FFT windows (frames)	                      Smaller values increase time resolution but slow down computation


n_mfcc value I have taken as 20 initially. I will experiment with different values too, and document the results but only in the end if time permits.
sr I am taking at 16000 i.e. 16kHz as it is taken a standard in speech ML Models
n_fft I am taking to be 2048 
hop_length as 512.
